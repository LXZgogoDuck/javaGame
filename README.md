## 🛠️ Implementation Highlights

### GUI (Login & Registration)
- Built using JavaFX, CSS, and FXML.
- Follows MVC pattern with `loginViewController`.
- User credentials stored securely in a MySQL database.

- Multithreaded game loop using `Runnable`.
- Four Game States: `MENU`, `PLAYING`, `OPTION`, `QUIT`.
- Components like `audioPlayer`, `Menu`, `Playing` initialized during startup.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- Player and Enemy Entities with collision detection.
- Player animations using 2D sprite arrays.
- Health and Attack stats for the player.

### Utilities
- `LoadSave`: Efficient image asset loading.
- `Constants`: Centralized game constants (gravity, speed, image sizes).
- `HelpMethods`: Movement logic and collision detection.

### Game UI
- Dynamic buttons with mouse events (`PauseButton` class).
- Smooth transitions and overlays between game states.

### Visual & Audio Effects
- Background rain and moving clouds for a vibrant atmosphere.
- Integrated sound effects for immersive gameplay.
